    OpenSpiel Environment wrapper for OpenEnv.

    This environment wraps OpenSpiel games and provides a single-agent interface.
    For multi-player games, the agent controls one player while opponent(s) use
    a fixed policy (e.g., random).

    Supported games:
    - Single-player: catch, cliff_walking, 2048, blackjack
    - Multi-player: tic_tac_toe, kuhn_poker

    Args:
        game_name: Name of the OpenSpiel game (e.g., "catch", "tic_tac_toe").
        agent_player: Which player ID the agent controls (default 0).
        opponent_policy: Policy for opponent players ("random", "first", etc.).
        game_params: Optional game-specific parameters.

    Example:
        >>> env = OpenSpielEnvironment("catch")
        >>> obs = env.reset()
        >>> print(obs.info_state)  # Agent's observation
